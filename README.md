# Virginia-PPP-loans-under-150K

The Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act was enacted by the U.S. Congress in March 2020 as a response to the historic economic disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its goal was to expeditiously provide economic relief to small businesses in the form of loans with the goal of keeping as many people employed as possible. A total of $659 billion was allocated from April 3rd until August 8th of 2020. 

This project is an analysis of all the PPP loans under $150,000 that were issued to Virginia businesses in 2020. CSV files containing data were obtained from the Small Business Administration. Rather than listing a specific type of business, an NAICS code was listed for each loan. Each NAICS code corresponds to an industry type and the first step was converting all the NAICS codes in order to get the exact industry for each loan that was issued.

Much of the demographic data requested from business owners in the loan applications such as race, ethnicity, gender or veteran status were missing. Disclosure was voluntary and the applicants were not required to provide that information. As a result, these factors were not considered or analyzed for this project.
