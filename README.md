# Virginia-PPP-loans-under-150K

This project is an analysis of all the PPP loans under $150,000 that were issued to Virginia businesses in 2020. CSV files containing data was obtained from the Small Business Administration. Rather than listing a specific type of business, an NAICS code was listed for each loan. Each NAICS code corresponds to an industry type and the first step was converting all the NAICS codes in order to get the exact industry for each loan that was issued.
