# Virginia-PPP-loans-under-150K

This project is an analysis of all the PPP loans under $150,000 that were issued to Virginia businesses in 2020. CSV files containing data were obtained from the Small Business Administration. Rather than listing a specific type of business, an NAICS code was listed for each loan. Each NAICS code corresponds to an industry type and the first step was converting all the NAICS codes in order to get the exact industry for each loan that was issued.

Much of the demographic data requested from business owners in the loan applications such as race, ethnicity, gender or veteran status were missing. Disclosure was voluntary and the applicants were not required to provide that information. As a result, these factors were not considered and analyzed for this project.
